# stubpage

The [tree style tab extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) is nice to have, however grouping is still a little bit troublesome.

This simple webpage provides a workaround where a simple input box is shown and whatever is inputed gets to the title of the page.
